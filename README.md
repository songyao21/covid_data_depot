This repository is maintained by Song Yao, Associate Professor of Marketing at the Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis. The purpose of this repository is to share the sample codes and data used in the research study "Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 under Different Reopening Strategies" by Meng Liu, Raphael Thomadsen, and Song Yao. The most recent version of the paper can be found at Song Yao's website www.songyao.org.
We also create a website forecasting the case spread in the US, which also contains a social distancing index for each State. Please visit the forecasting website at https://covidforecast.wustl.edu/.
